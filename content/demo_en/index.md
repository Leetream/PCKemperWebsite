Thank you for your interest in testing my current study! You will play a short interactive video game and then you will be asked some questions about it. The entire participation should take about 15-20 minutes.

This version of the study is still under revision and does not represent the final version of the video game and questionnaire. Your participation will help to improve this study. Thank you very much for this.

Please do not pass on the access data or the contents of the video game and the questionnaire to third parties, neither completely nor partially.

To participate, please ensure that you are using a desktop or laptop computer or a mobile tablet and that you are in a quiet place.
