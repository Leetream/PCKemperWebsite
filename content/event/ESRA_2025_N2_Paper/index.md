location: Utrecht University, Room Ruppert rood - 0.51

summary: Experimentally test the effects of citizen-state interactions in a virtual state.
abstract: 'Using an online vignette environment within a virtual state we call Novaland, we examine how variations in public-service quality and corruption  affect political solidarity. Participants make positive, negative, or negative-and-corrupt public  service delivery experiences and engage in everyday activities, ensuring immersive and attentive participation. We test propositions grounded in a social contract model, showing that support for domain-specific public spending increases under poor service delivery, but support increases less when corruption  is present besides poor service delivery alone. This support seems not to translate into a demand for more general welfare spending. Political trust declines over time when quality is low, especially when corruption is present. These findings underscore the importance of equitable and efficient public services in maintaining both political solidarity and trust. As public service quality declines in many European states, our study suggests that unmet public expectations risk eroding  political solidarity in public domains and political trust.'
